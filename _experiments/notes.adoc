main, div etc. are block level elements  (display: block)

height: 100%  only work if height of parent is defined (rsp. not determined by its children)

box-sizing: content-box;  // default            padding & border are not included in size
box-sizing: border-box;   // often preferred    padding & border are     included in size

```
    * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }
```

#### display property (block, inline, inline-block, none, ...)
    display:inline elements 
        cannot have margin-top, margin-bottom
        cannot have width and height (is set to auto)
        have different behaviour for padding-top padding-bottom
            padding still pushes away borders but
            padding, border or margin will not push away other elements, they overlap (https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/understanding-inline-box-model/) 

    display: inline-block elements 
        are mixed: can be placed on same line but are able to handle margin-top, margin-bottom etc.
        can have whitespace issue: whitespace in html (sometimes) is treated as additional inline element which messes up size calculations (Lecture 39)

    display:none elements are still in the dom but removed from document flow ( vs. visibility:hidden where it is still part of the document flow)


#### margin collapsing
- https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/css-basics-understanding-collapsing-margins--cms-34272

    1.  Block Level Elements
        Collapsible margins are only possible when using block-level elements.

    2.  Margins Only Collapse Vertically
        Only vertically adjoining margins will collapse, and even then not always.

    3.  Padding, Borders, and Clearance
        If we added padding, border, or clearance to the elements in the above examples, the collapsing will not be applied. In other words, one way of getting rid of collapsible margin behavior is to add some sort of separation (border, padding, or clearance) between the margins. 


vertical-align:middle
    needs to be set on all elements of the row not just the one which isn't aligned


class vs id selector
    prefer class, don't just add id for styling (id has other purposes too, like for web links e.g. href="#intro")

:not(.hover) 
    can usually be avoided by declaring properties for all and then declare for .hover

    a.active {...}
    a:not(.active) {...}

    vs 

    a.active {...}
    a {...}


margin: auto
    centers horizontally (vertically doesn't work)

<xxx>: inherit
    use values that would be inherited (instead of defaults, e.g. browser defaults)
    
text-align: <xxx>
    not only for text, e.g. for centering child inline elements too

Unlike inline-block & block elements, inline elements are immune to changing height & width!! They are only as big as they need to be. 


#### position property

position property applies to all elements (block, inline, inline-block)

z-index applies to elements with position property set ( rsp. != position: static )

When setting position property (e.g. position: fixed) element is taken out of document flow and displayed in front of other elements. Therefore element is still in front when z-index:0. z-index:-1 then moves it behind others

Positioning context for position:...
|===
| *position:...*        | *Positioning Context*                                                 | *Taken out of Document-Flow*  
| fixed                 | Viewport                                                              | yes                           
| absolute              | Closest parent with a position property, or else the <html> element   | yes                           
| relative              | Position of myself                                                    | no                            
|===


overflow:hidden on parent lets child elements disappear if they move out of the parents area.

overflow:hidden on <body> does not work on its own. (CSS behaviour/issue) You HAVE to specify overflow:... on <html> element too.

Stacking Context:
- child cannot move behind its parent
- child cannot move in front of parents siblings which are in front of parent
- position:fixed & sticky always creates new stacking context
- position:absolute & relative only create new stacking context when z-index is set too
